> You are tasked with developing an ATM PIN validation system. The system should allow a user to enter their 4-digit PIN and validate it against a predefined correct PIN (5678). If the user enters the wrong PIN, they should be prompted to try again. However, if the user enters the wrong PIN 3 consecutive times, the system should block the card and display a message that the card is blocked. The user should no longer be able to attempt to enter the PIN after the card is blocked.
