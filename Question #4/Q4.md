> You are tasked with developing a Messaging Streak Tracker for a social media app (similar to Snapchat streaks). The app tracks how many consecutive days two users send messages to each other.
<br> > • Each day, the user must send a message to their friend to maintain the streak.
<br> > • If the user fails to send a message on any day, the streak is reset to 0.
<br> > • The system should track the streak and update it based on whether the user sent a message that day.
