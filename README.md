This repository includes the following:-
- Answers of the Questions provided in the Assignment #6 of the PF LAB.

## Details:
Answers of Question #1 to Question #7 arranged in a folder containing 2 files each of .exe and .o files.
**Question #1:** Which loop system would be better for user input. Justify your answer by creating a program that
takes a value and adds it to a variable and prints it repeatedly until the user enters a zero value.

**Question #2:** Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers between two given integers a and b. Use
a loop to find the sum and print the result.
Example:
• Input: a = 4, b = 10
• Output: Sum of even numbers = 28 (4 + 6 + 8 + 10)

**Question #3:** You are tasked with developing an ATM PIN validation system. The system should allow a user to enter
their 4-digit PIN and validate it against a predefined correct PIN (5678). If the user enters the wrong PIN,
they should be prompted to try again. However, if the user enters the wrong PIN 3 consecutive times,
the system should block the card and display a message that the card is blocked. The user should no
longer be able to attempt to enter the PIN after the card is blocked.

**Question #4:** You are tasked with developing a Messaging Streak Tracker for a social media app (similar to Snapchat streaks). The app tracks how many consecutive days two users send messages to each other.
• Each day, the user must send a message to their friend to maintain the streak.
• If the user fails to send a message on any day, the streak is reset to 0.
• The system should track the streak and update it based on whether the user sent a message that day.

**Question #5:** Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not.

**Question #6:** Using the above program integrate the number if it is a prime and print the Fibonacci series till that number.
Example
Input: 5 Output:
Number is prime
Series is = 0 1 1 2 3

**Question #8:** Write a program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.
